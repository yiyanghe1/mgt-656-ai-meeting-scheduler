- • Sample data script made testing easy and repeatable

### Team Collaboration
- • Clear division of tasks allowed parallel work
- • Good communication about database schema decisions
- • Code reviews helped catch configuration issues early
- • Documentation was maintained throughout the sprint

### Process
- • Sprint planning was thorough and realistic
- • Story points were accurately estimated
- • Daily standups (if held) kept team aligned
- • Definition of Done was clear and achievable

### Deployment Success
- • Staging deployment completed early in sprint
- • Database connection issues identified and resolved quickly
- • Environment variable setup was straightforward
- • Application accessible and working as expected

## What Didn't Go Well 😞

### Technical Challenges
- • Initial database connection issues in staging (resolved)
- • Some confusion about Render deployment configuration (documented now)
- • Environment variable setup took longer than expected
- • Static files configuration required some trial and error

### Team Challenges
- • [To be filled by team]
- • [To be filled by team]
- • Some team members needed extra time to set up development environment

### Process Issues
- • Could have started deployment testing earlier
- • Test coverage could have been more comprehensive from the start
- • Some documentation was written after implementation (should be done earlier)

### Time Management
- • Deployment took longer than estimated
- • Database migration testing could have been done earlier
- • Sample data script was created later than ideal

## What We Will Improve 💪

### Technical Improvements
1. **Start deployment testing earlier**
   - Test database connection in staging on day 1
   - Verify environment variables work before final deployment
   - Action: Create deployment checklist and test early

2. **Improve test coverage**
   - Write tests alongside features, not after
   - Add integration tests for database operations
   - Action: Make testing part of Definition of Done

3. **Better error handling**
   - Add try-catch blocks for database operations
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Action: Add error handling to all database queries

4. **Documentation as we go**
   - Write README updates during development
   - Document deployment process immediately
   - Action: Update docs in same PR as code changes

### Process Improvements
1. **Daily standups**
   - [To be filled by team]
   - Share blockers early
   - Action: Schedule regular standup times

2. **Code review process**
   - Review PRs within 24 hours
   - Use PR templates for consistency
   - Action: Set up PR review reminders

3. **Deployment process**
   - Create deployment checklist
   - Test in staging before marking story complete
   - Action: Document deployment steps in DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
